- The in-memory tile cache's size is not bounded.
- Using the volume control buttons is a really poor way to zoom.
- Check for updates to cached tiles (Paolo Cavallini).
- Tiles are fetched multiple times when translating if an outstanding
  tile request has not yet returned.
- Translating (moving) the image should not require the tiles to be
  redrawn on each move - the image should be translated and new tiles
  drawn when available.

Wishlist:
- Logo/icon (Ted Percival).
- Store map tiles on the SD card for offline use (Weston Weems,
  Bernd Schnuermacher).
- Multitouch (Weston Weems).
