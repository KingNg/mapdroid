- Mapdroid crashes if you zoom in too far.
- The back button does not exit the application.
- The in-memory tile cache's size is not bounded.
- Using the volume control buttons is a really poor way to zoom.

Wishlist:
- Store map tiles on the SD card for offline use (Weston Weems,
  Bernd Schnuermacher).
- Multitouch (Weston Weems).
